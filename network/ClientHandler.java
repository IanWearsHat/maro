            This didn't have the same problem as me, but someone threw the idea that the stream should run .reset() to forget everything in the stream, and that worked.
            Their explanation was that the outStream was being created even though the server socket's (called clientSocket here for convenience) 
            output stream was already used, but these previous lines are the first instance of an outstream being used, so that doesn't work.  */
